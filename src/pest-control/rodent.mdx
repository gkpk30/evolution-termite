Our team of experts is highly trained in identifying the signs of rodent infestations, [the differences between rats and mice](../important-differences-between-rats-mice), including droppings, gnaw marks , and nests. We use a variety of methods to remove rodents from your property, including trapping, baiting, and exclusion. Our goal is to eliminate the problem quickly and effectively, while also taking steps to prevent future infestations.

## Trapping, Baiting and Humane Traps

Trapping is a commonly used method for rodent removal. Our team uses humane traps to capture rodents without harming them, and we release them far away from your property to ensure that they do not return. Baiting is also an effective way to eliminate rodents, as it attracts them to poison or traps. However, it's important to use caution when using baits, as they can be harmful to pets or children if not handled properly.

## Prevent Future Infestations

In addition to removing existing rodents from your property, we also take steps to prevent future infestations. Our team will identify and seal any entry points that rodents may be using to enter your property. We also provide recommendations for keeping your property clean and free of clutter, as this can help prevent rodents from finding a suitable nesting place.
